"""
this agent is a seperate page in FE where
a user can ask the agent to create a video an explain the topic.
we use manim library to create the videos 
a seperate vectorDB section with all the docs for manim library can be loaded to the agent,
that writes the code to create the videos. 
we need to find a way to add voice over to it as well. 
create a seperate agent for this and try to integerate this via A2A
